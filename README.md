  - side_eviction: timing side-channel based eviction
  - side_flush: timing side-channel based flush


## 2. Transient Execution Attack Primitives

- transient_execution_attack_primitives:
  - T1_primitive: indirect jump transient execution
  - T2_primitive: ssl transient execution
  - T3_primitive: RSB transient execution
  - PMP Attack Primitive

## 3. aes_ttable

- AES T-table attack
